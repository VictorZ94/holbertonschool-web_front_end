### Overview

This design is to practice all what I have learned in HTML CSS.
Building a web page the right way, is not easy. 

### Technical used

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
- flexbox

### limited
No framework such as "bootstrap" only css
