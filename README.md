## Html advanced

html creates the foundation of any HTML page

HTML is about content. CSS is about the look and feel.

### Doctype

The <doctype> is necessary at the top of every HTML page to force the browser to render the page according to relevant specifications.

> **Note:** There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.

```
<!-- Doctype HTML5 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Lowercase is also valid -->
<!doctype html>
```

### HTML tag

The <html> HTML tag tells the browser that the document is an HTML webpage. It is used as a container for all the HTML elements.

>**Warning!**
The doctype is the only element living outside the html tag.

```
<html lang="fr" dir="ltr">
```
